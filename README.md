This is the repository of my personal web page along with my web dev projects. The main site will become available very soon, please wait patiently for it. 
Meanwhile you can try some of my projects live versions:

**WeirdShapes**.
A web demo that allows you to draw awesome shapes and play with some of their settings.

**Bouncing Balls [Improvement]**. I improved an already amazing demo developed by Chris in his [MDN course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Adding_bouncing_balls_features). I added multiplayer and diagonal direction features.

**tabFx**. A web extension that allows you to filter opened tabs similar to the active one in a smart way.

There are more mini demo/projects in the repository as well as activites that I had finished over the time. But I can't list them all.
