    <p>I've always asked my self that question. Who doesn't love Ice Creams? But the answer is clear. Ice cream is like candies for kids. Only creatures of other dimensions where Ice Cream is not Ice Cream could not enjoy a sweet, frozen delicacy like Ice Cream is.</p>
    <p>You can choose one of the more popular flavors of Ice Cream that exists</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pistachio</li>
      <li>Strawberry</li>
      <li>Chocolate</li>
      <li>Coconut</li>
      <li>Vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    <p>or maybe choose one of the many exotic flavors that are out there.</p>
    <p> Are you a person of culture? Then you should definitely read about the History of Ice cream in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream#History">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
